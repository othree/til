Test Anything Protocol
======================

[Test Anything Protocol][tap](TAP) is a standard for unit test communite to test harness.
First seen as part of the Perlâ€™s core test harness. 
Have a plan to suibmit it to IETF([draft][]). But not done yet.

There are lots of [reporters][] supports TAP.
For JavaScript development, [tape][] by James Halliday(@substack) and [AVA][] are very popular.

More information can be found at [TAP][tap] homepage and [awesome-tap list][awesome-tap].
